Hello! My name is John Chen :)

Happy to see you here! I am studying mechanical engineer at Cal Poly Pomona and I look forward to working with you!
A breif summary of myself, I am a student who asipres to be a mechanical designer. Currently, I've applied my knowledge of mechanical properties and CAD to create some models/mechanical-analyses of existing products in order to further analyze the "how" of their functions. Through this I hope to gain more knowledge from the designers of today in order to improve and compete. With my knowledge of CAD and my personal ingenuity I believe I got what it takes to get the job done.
